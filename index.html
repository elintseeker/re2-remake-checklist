      <p><strong>Notes:</strong> <strong>This is the bare minimum checklist and guide for Resident Evil 2</strong> and the steps outlined below is from a speedrun. Take what you need along the way or go back to areas when you need to or if you forgot something. When pausing the game, <strong>open the options screen instead</strong>. Not the map or the inventory, so that the in-game timer actually stops. Lastly, when reloading a game, exit to the title and load your save/autosave from there.</p>
